sort.h - Header file, holds function prototypes and all necessary includes.
sort.1 - man page for the sort utility
Makefile - instructions for compiling the program

3. No known bugs.

4. Estimated time - 8 hrs
Actual time - 5 hrs
The sorting was a lot easier than I thought, probably because it's super simple to use qsort.

5. I have adhered to the honor code in this assignment
